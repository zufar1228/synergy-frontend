This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Progressive Web App

This project ships with basic Progressive Web App (PWA) support so it can be installed on desktop or mobile browsers:

- Web App Manifest served from `/manifest.webmanifest` with start URL `/dashboard`
- Client-side service worker registered from `public/sw.js` for simple offline caching
- Works over HTTPS (required for service workers); local development can use `pnpm dev --experimental-https`

### Testing the PWA

1. Run `pnpm run build && pnpm start` or `pnpm dev --experimental-https`
2. Open the app in Chrome/Edge/Safari
3. Use the browser's install prompt (or Add to Home Screen) to install the app
4. Launch the installed app to verify it opens directly to `/dashboard`
